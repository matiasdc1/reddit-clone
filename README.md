# Reddit Clone FrontEnd (React Native App)

This is a simple clone based on the Reddit App. It will not work by itself, since some information is fetched with the API in the reddit-clone-express app you can find in my repositories. Make sure to install it first.

## Installation

You must have expo already installed on your PC.
You must have a valid Android emulation device running. For this, install Android Studio, create a new AVD and start it.

Clone the repository to your PC. Then:

```js
npm install
expo start
```

The first command will install all dependencies.

The second command will set up the expo server for emulation.

Open the expo server under the indicated port and select android emulation.

Thats it!
